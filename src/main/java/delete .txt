I am excited by your company's vision and look forward to speaking with you about this role.

Hello Dr.Barot

I am feeling low, getting angry fast, anxiety, crying, not able to focus and not feeling good to talk with anyone.  
I am not feeling good about myself. I am feeling I am not ready to go back to work.
Feeling okay with baby and other works around home. But internally I feel I am not right. 
It started around 2 weeks back and still not feeling better, thought it would get better with time. 
But I feel it is only increasing with time.

Anger
Anxiety to get things done and tasks getting piled up, causing frustration and anger
Less foucs because my mind keeps wandering here and there. Pumping baby stuff etc

This is a programming test
To get familiarized with our coding environment, try our Sample Test
You are free to choose any language from the list and code
If the code area contains the function signature, just complete the function alone, we'll take care of the main function, headers, etc
If you're expected to write the full code, it'd be mentioned in the code area. All inputs are from STDIN and output to STDOUT. If you're using Java, use the classname as 'Solution'
To understand more about the environment, time limits, etc. you can read the FAQ here
In coding questions, you can print to console to debug your code using the appropriate print command for each language (Eg: cout for C++, printf for C, etc.)
